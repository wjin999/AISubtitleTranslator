# AISubtitleTranslator

This project is a product of vibe coding.

The script's advantage lies in its unique two-step translation process: it first generates a summary of the entire text to grasp the overall context, and then provides this summary as background information while translating smaller segments. This method greatly enhances contextual coherence and cleverly avoids the issue of sending overly long prompts to the API.
